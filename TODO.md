# TO DO LIST

## Refactoring

- move all instances of `Text.ts` to the file itself, with loads of exports such as `PageTitleText`, `SectionTitleText`, etc.

## TypeScript

- remove all `: any` instances
- Hammersmith Apollo bug when ading indexed types to `VENUES` file
- add absolute paths/imports
- remove all instances of `@ts-ignore` if possible

## Data

- move data to a database and call with APIs

## Tests

- add tests to all utils functions
- add snapshot tests to components

## Fix

- do not use `â€¢` in lists, figure out why the CSS is suppressing it
