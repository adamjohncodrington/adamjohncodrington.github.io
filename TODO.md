## Refactoring

- [ ] add section types to page sections, e.g. `recipes`, `eventCards`, `simpleList`, `nestedList`, etc.
- [ ] merge `sections`, `routes` and `config`?
- [ ] automatically sort all section entries by date
- [ ] move all instances of `Text.js` to the file itself, with loads of exports such as `PageTitleText`, `SectionTitleText`, etc.
