# TO DO LIST

## Refactoring

- move all instances of `Text.ts` to the file itself, with loads of exports such as `PageTitleText`, `SectionTitleText`, etc.

## TypeScript

- remove all instances of `any`
- add absolute paths/imports
- remove all instances of `@ts-ignore` where possible

## Tests

- add tests to all utils functions
- add snapshot tests to components

## Data

- store data to a database and call with APIs

## Fix

- do not use `â€¢` in lists, figure out why the CSS is suppressing it
