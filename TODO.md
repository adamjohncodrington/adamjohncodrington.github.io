# TO DO LIST


## Refactoring

- review `factory.ts` files
- amalgamate `data` and `pages` folders, there is too much overlap
- move final instances of `px` in `EventCard` and `RecipeCard` to `theme`
- rationalise theme
- rationalise `data-test` attributes
- review semantics of page structure, landmarks, accessibility, etc.

## TypeScript

- remove as many instances of `any` and `@ts-ignore` as possible


## Data

- store data to a database and call with APIs
