# TO DO LIST

- style `CountedListItemDetails` and move all values to theme
- make `Worthy Farm` display as `Glastonbury`, `HeatonPark` display as `Parklife`, `Store Street` display as `WHP`, etc.
- add details to loads of counted list items (including travel)

## Testing

- add tests for more utils

## New features

- friends section reveals which gigs you saw with them
- add photos to `Travel`?

## Enhancements

- address `MARINA` vs. `Marina and the Diamonds`
- refine Nav Bar (colors persist for active page, mobile behaviour)
- prevent `Router` from allowing you to go back between pages?

## Styling

- reduce whitespace between bullet points and list text?
- refine color palette
- prevent wrapping of `li` text beneath the bullet point

## Refactoring

- refactor how `CITIES` is generated
- review semantics of page structure, landmarks, accessibility, etc.
- recipe method array should be `ol` not `ul`?
- rationalise `data-test` attributes
