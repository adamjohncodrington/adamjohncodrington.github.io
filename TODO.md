# TO DO LIST

## Refactoring

- move all instances of `Text.js` to the file itself, with loads of exports such as `PageTitleText`, `SectionTitleText`, etc.
- avoid having to type out `â€¢` in lists, use natural CSS instead

## TypeScript

- Hammersmith Apollo bug when ading indexed types to `VENUES` file
- strongly type all locations types
- review all instances of type `any`
- add absolute paths/imports
- remove all instances of `@ts-ignore` if possible

## Data
